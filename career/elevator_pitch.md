# Cover Letter

I'm a seasoned software engineering manager with a newfound passion for AI and machine learning. I've enjoyed a robust software engineering career at companies like Microsoft, Deloitte, Intuit, and Nike.

After a sabbatical to care for family, I've completed a Data Science boot camp and now seek a new direction in machine learning and data engineering where I can leverage my current experience to support those world-changing fields, and at the same time continue to grow and learn.

I have current expertise in Python, SQL, and data wrangling, and a strong background in software engineering, and data architecture. 

I'm now looking for a ground level, hands-on role where I can leverage my current experience to support those exiting fields, either in an MLOPS or data engineering capacity, and at the same time continue to grow and learn in the field.

# Friends Cover Letter
Hi there.  It's been a while.  I hope you're doing well.  This is one of those awkward moments when you realize that you have not been very good at keeping in touch, even with people you liked and respected, and now you are forced to broadcast a cold request.  Please do not feel compelled in any way to respond.  But if you have a moment, I'd love to hear from you and perhaps even get some feedback, otherwise, I completely understand. 

This year I needed to move back to California and take a sabbatical to care for family members.  I did spend some time helping a start-up with educational material, and I had an epiphany of sorts that I wanted to be an individual contributor.  I've completed a Data Science/Machine Learning boot camp, and while I'm under no illusion that I am a data scientist, I am very interested in MLOps and data engineering.  I'm looking for a ground level, hands-on role where I can leverage my current experience as a team member to support those exiting fields, and at the same time continue to grow and learn in the field.

I've compiled all of my particulars on this personal website www.chrisjlomeli.com.  I'd love to hear from you, but if you're too busy, I understand, and I truly wish you the very best.
